	// One reason a timer may be useful is that you can cancel the timer
	// before it fires. Here’s an example of that.

	// to show it is in fact stopped.
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

	// The first timer will fire ~2s after we start the program,
	// but the second should be stopped before it has a chance to fire.
